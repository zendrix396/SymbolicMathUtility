# Symbolic Math Utility

Symbolic Math Utility is a web application that allows users to perform symbolic mathematical operations such as differentiation, integration, and partial differentiation. The application features a modern UI with both dark and light modes and provides real-time results with smooth transitions.

## Features
- **Symbolic Derivatives:** Calculate the derivative of a mathematical expression.
- **Integrals:** Compute the integral of a given function.
- **Partial Derivatives:** Calculate partial derivatives with respect to a specified variable.
- **Dark/Light Mode:** Toggle between dark and light themes.
- **Smooth Animations:** UI transitions are powered by Framer Motion.
- **Error Handling:** Displays meaningful error messages when computations fail.
